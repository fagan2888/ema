Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme. Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events. Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10-13 g/dl [6.2-8.1 mmol/l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.

Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis-B viral replication (presence of DNA of hepatitis-B virus (HBV-DNA) and hepatitis-B antigen (HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and histologically proven active liver inflammation and / or fibrosis.
Chronic hepatitis C
Before initiating treatment with IntronA, consideration should be given to the results from clinical trials comparing IntronA with pegylated interferon.
Adult patients
IntronA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for hepatitis-C virus-RNA (HCV-RNA).
The best way to use IntronA in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.
Childrenthree years of age and older and adolescents
IntronA is indicated, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of childrenthree years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver decompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA. When deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients.
The decision to treat should be made on a case-by-case basis.
Hairy-cell leukaemia
Treatment of patients with hairy cell leukaemia.
Chronic myelogenous leukaemia
Monotherapy
Treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia-chromosome- or bcr/abl-translocation-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia.
Clinical experience indicates that a haematological and cytogenetic major / minor response is obtainable in the majority of patients treated. A major cytogenetic response is defined by  34 % Ph+ leukaemic cells in the bone marrow, whereas a minor response is  34 %, but  90 % Ph+ cells in the marrow.
Combination therapy
The combination of interferon alfa-2b and cytarabine (Ara-C) administered during the first 12 months of treatment has been demonstrated to significantly increase the rate of major cytogenetic responses and to significantly prolong the overall survival at three years when compared to interferon alfa-2b monotherapy.
Multiple myeloma
As maintenance therapy in patients who have achieved objective remission (more than 50% reduction in myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy.
Current clinical experience indicates that maintenance therapy with interferon alfa-2b prolongs the plateau phase; however, effects on overall survival have not been conclusively demonstrated.
Follicular lymphoma
Treatment of high-tumour-burden follicular lymphoma as adjunct to appropriate combination induction chemotherapy such as a CHOP-like regimen. High tumour burden is defined as having at least one of the following: bulky tumour mass ( 7 cm), involvement of three or more nodal sites (each  3 cm), systemic symptoms (weight loss  10 %, pyrexia  38C for more thaneight days, or nocturnal sweats), splenomegaly beyond the umbilicus, major organ obstruction or compression syndrome, orbital or epidural involvement, serous effusion, or leukaemia.
Carcinoid tumour
Treatment of carcinoid tumours with lymph node or liver metastases and with 'carcinoid syndrome'.

Ribavirin Teva is indicated, in combination with interferon alfa-2b, for the treatment of adult patients with all types of chronic hepatitis C except genotype 1, not previously treated, without liver decompensation, with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), who are positive for hepatitis C viral ribonucleic acid HCV-RNA.
Paediatric patients (children 3 years of age and older and adolescents)
Ribavirin Teva is indicated, in a combination regimen with interferon alfa2b, for the treatment of children and adolescents 3 years of age and older, who have all types of chronic hepatitis C except genotype 1, not previously treated, without liver decompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA.
When deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that may be irreversible in some patients. The reversibility of growth inhibition is uncertain. The decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis.

Post-exposure prevention in individuals one year of age or older following contact with a clinically diagnosed influenza case when influenza virus is circulating in the community.
The appropriate use of Tamiflu for prevention of influenza should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the circumstances and the population requiring protection.

Tamiflu is not a substitute for influenza vaccination.
The use of antivirals for the treatment and prevention of influenza should be determined on the basis of official recommendations.

This fixed combination replaces the three components (abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine) used separately in similar dosages. It is recommended that treatment is started with abacavir, lamivudine,and zidovudine separately for the firstsix to eight weeks. The choice of this fixed combination should be based not only on potential adherence criteria, but mainly on expected efficacy and risk related to the three nucleoside analogues.
The demonstration of the benefit of Trizivir is mainly based on results of studies performed in treatment naive patients or moderately antiretroviral experienced patients with non-advanced disease.
In patients with high viral load (100,000 copies/ml) choice of therapy needs special consideration.
Overall, the virologic suppression with this triple nucleoside regimen could be inferior to that obtained with other multitherapies notably including boosted protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, therefore the use of Trizivir should only be considered under special circumstances (e.g. co-infection with tuberculosis).
Before initiating treatment with abacavir, screening for carriage of the HLA-B*5701 allele should be performed in any HIV-infected patient, irrespective of racial origin. Screening is also recommended prior to re-initiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLA-B*5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir (see 'management after an interruption of Trizivir therapy').
